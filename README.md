# Information Retrieval Course Notes

I happened to found this course about Information Retrieval(IR) from Youtube long time ago, and save it to 
my playlist, as usual. Recently, I've just got started to work with ElasticSearch and want to get some background knowledge.
So I take out this course from my playlist, and it turns out to be a great course.   

All original materials are collected from GitHub and the course website, and I rewrite them using Go because
I use Go for my daily work. If you found it useful, feel free to do anything.
