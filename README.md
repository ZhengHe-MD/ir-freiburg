# Information Retrieval Course Notes

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ZhengHe-MD/ir-freiburg.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ZhengHe-MD/ir-freiburg)

I happened to found this course about Information Retrieval(IR) from Youtube long time ago, and save it to 
my playlist, as usual. Recently, I've just got started to work with ElasticSearch and want to get some background knowledge.
So I take out this course from my playlist, and it turns out to be a great course.   

All original materials are collected from GitHub and the course website. I rewrite the provided codes using Go because
I use it for my daily work. If you found this repo useful, feel free to fork and play around with it. 

## Details

### Lecture-01 ✅

##### Topics

* Keyword Search
* Inverted Index
* One, Two and More Words
* Zipf's Law

In-class demo and exercise code can be found in [lecture-01 directory](./lecture-01). The [script.sh](./lecture-01/script.sh) contains all runnable examples you need. 

### Lecture-02 ✅

##### Topics

* Ranking
  * Term Frequency (tf)
  * Document Frequency (df)
  * tf.idf
  * BM25 (best match)
* Evaluation
  * Precision (P@K)
  * Average Precision (AP)
  * Mean Precisions (MP@k, MP@R, MAP)
  * Discounted Cumulative Gain (DCG)
  * Binary Preference (bpref)

In-class demo and exercies code can be found in [lecture-02 directory](./lecture-02). The [script.sh](./lecture-02/script.sh) contains the command to benchmark on movies dataset. It's counter-intuitive that the provided [movies-benchmark.txt](./data/movies-benchmark.txt) start counting docID at 2, which conflicts with the provided unit test cases in [TIP file](./lecture-02/sheet-02.TIP) either. So I write a [script](./data/process_movies_benchmark.go) to process the movies-benchmark.txt, make it start counting docID at 1, the result benchmark file [movies-benchmark-minus-1.txt](./data/movies-benchmark-minus-1.txt) is also provided in the [data directory](./data).

### Lecture-03 ✅

* List intersection
  * Intersection and merge
  * Time measurement (repeat 5 times at least)
* Non-algorithmic improvements
  * Naive arrays, ArrayList in Java, std::vector in C++
  * Predictable branches (cpu pipelining, reduce guessing)
  * Sentinels (avoid condition testing)
* Algorithmic improvements
  * Preliminaries: smaller list A with k elements, longer list B with n elements
  * Binary search in the longer list, θ(klogn)
  * Binary search in the remainder of longer list, best case θ(k+logn), worst case θ(klogn), average case θ(klogn)
  * Galloping search, O(klog(1+n/k))
  * Skip Pointers

### Lecture-04 ✅

* Compression
  * Motivation
  * Memory & Disk
  * Gap encoding
    * Idea: stores differences (always positive integers) instead of raw doc ids.
    * Binary representation
    * Prefix-free codes: decoding from left to right is unambiguous.
* Codes
  * Elias-Gamma (1975)
  * Elias-Delta (1975)
  * Golomb (1966)
  * Variable-Bytes (VB)
  * Other codes: ANS
* Entropy (theory part)
  * Motivation: Which code compresses the best? It depends on the distributions. The intuition is that **more frequent less bits**.
  * Shannon's source coding theorem (1948)
    * In plain words: **No code can be better than the entropy, and there is always a code that is (almost) as good**.
    
### Lecture-05 ✅

* Fuzzy Search
* Edit distance
* q-Gram Index
