# Information Retrieval Course Notes

I happened to found this course about Information Retrieval(IR) from Youtube long time ago, and save it to 
my playlist, as usual. Recently, I've just got started to work with ElasticSearch and want to get some background knowledge.
So I take out this course from my playlist, and it turns out to be a great course.   

All original materials are collected from GitHub and the course website, and I rewrite them using Go because
I use it for my daily work. If you found this repo useful, feel free to fork and do anything.

## Details

### Lecture-01

In-class demo and exercise code can be found in [lecture-01 directory](./lecture-01). The [script.sh](./lecture-01/script.sh) contains all runnable examples you need. Exercise sheet for 2017/2018 semester has not been published. I found an old version of 2012/2013 semester from the repo [eamsen/ir-edu](https://github.com/eamsen/ir-edu), and also provide [that](./lecture-01/exercise-sheet-01.pdf) in this repo for convenience.
