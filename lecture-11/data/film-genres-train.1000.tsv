But the settlers soon discover they are in land populated with indigenous tribes, ready to fight the red-faced invaders. Jandamarra is born into this turmoil in 1873. His spirit country, on his father's side, is a land called Djumbud. His mother Jinny, a powerful and independent woman, belongs to the Lennard River flat lands. At the age of six, Jinny takes Jandamarra onto William Lukin's million-acre cattle station at Lennard River Flats. Jandamarra quickly excels in all pastoral skills - much to the pride of Lukin who, like other settlers, boasts about his stockmen's abilities as tribute to his own skills of tutelage and management. Jandamarra remains at Lennard River Flats until it is time for him to be initiated into Bunuba law. His uncle Ellemarra is a very powerful influence during this period of intense education and rapid personal growth. But Jandamarra's passage into manhood is interrupted when they are both arrested and jailed for spearing a sheep. When he is released from custody, Jandamarra is banished from Bunuba society because sexual relationships he has had with various women, have broken strict kinship rules. With nowhere else to go, Jandamarra is assimilated into settler culture and ends up working with Constable Richardson who is, himself, an outsider in his own community. Their relationship is a strange one and oddly close - until that fateful night when Jandamarra kills Richardson, and returns to his people. Now fugitives, Jandamarra, Ellemarra and others attack a party of stockmen who are driving a large herd of cattle into the heart of Bunuba land. Two of the white men, Burke and Gibbs, are killed. This is the first time that guns are used by Aboriginals against European settlers in an organised fashion. Across Western Australia, enraged white colonialists bay for vengeance. A posse of 30 heavily armed police and settlers attack Jandamarra, Ellemarra and their followers at Windjana Gorge. In the ensuing battle, Ellemarra is killed and Jandamarra is seriously wounded, but escapes through a labyrinth of caves. Jandamarra recovers and leads a guerilla war against the settlers from hideouts in the caves and surrounding ranges of Windjana Gorge and Tunnel Creek. But the rebellion comes at a very high price as police and station owners embark on a military-style operation against Aboriginal camps throughout the region. Many Aboriginal people are killed in the massacres that ensue. Jandamarra responds by modifying his tactics. He doesn't kill any more settlers but embarks on a three year terror campaign - killing stock and stealing provisions from under the settlers' noses at night - deliberately leaving behind footmarks and other traces that tell the settlers that he's been there and could have killed them very easily, if he had wanted to. The police try to pursue Jandamarra after his raids but he always seems to find a way to elude capture.

Documentary	Beneath the quiet veneer of Iceland lies an invisible nation of Hidden People. This fascinating phenomenon, rarely discussed with outsiders, not only pervades Icelandic culture, but also impacts its infrastructure (e.g., road construction and buildings). This enlightening journey, through Iceland's celestial and mysterious environment, suspends one's state of reality-forcing you to question your own perceptual limitations and the mysteries of the natural world. Delving further into the stories of the hidden people, it is impossible not to consider the impact of the geographic position and isolation of this mysterious, celestial island of Iceland. Winter's darkness allows the dazzling and supernatural Northern Lights to pervade the country with its amorphous shapes; casting brilliant colors of yellow, pink, and green downward to the land below. Black lava rocks, green mossy rocks, geysers, volcanoes, and glaciers all play their role in this mystical landscape, where the wind, snow and light show the power of nature. These spectacular displays reveal the paradoxes that man must contend with-the simplicity of things that we see on a daily basis versus the complexity of things we are unable to see within the world.

Western	In 1875, in Arizona Territory, rancher John Rutherford plans to forcibly evict all squatters from his lands. The rancher welcomes his son Roy who has just returned home from England. He also hires a group of mercenaries to assist him in evicting squatters from his property. These hired goons and cutthroats are paid 500 dollars each. Their foreman is Hook who owes his nickname to the hook that replaced his missing right hand. Rutherford has also brought along his bookkeeper, Mr. Avery, to pay the men. During the Civil War, Mr. Avery avoided the draft, due to his bad health but he proudly wears a Confederate officer's uniform. On Rutherford's lands there is one remaining unfriendly squatter, Corey Everett, who stubbornly refuses to leave. His shack is at the deep end of a boxed canyon. Corey Everett has transformed his shack into a reinforced fortress. He dug a water well near his shack and this can help him outlast any siege, since there is no other source of water for 200 miles around. Nevertheless, rancher Rutherford, his son and the hired team of mercenaries are determined to oust Corey Everett from the property. Everett thinks he's entitled to live there since the canyon was deserted when he arrived and since he's been farming a small plot of land nearby for many years. Rutherford sends a scout to get water from Everett's water well and to assess the situation. The scout arrives at Everett's well but an irate armed Everett exits the shack and tells the scout to get water and leave. The scout leaves the area observing that at every window of the shack there is a rifle pointing at him. The scout returns to Rutherford's camp where he reports his findings. Meanwhile, a family of passers-by, Louis and Hannah Ferber and their son Albie, riding a wagon, arrive in the canyon and head for the water well. A suspicious Everett allows them to draw water from the well. While the strangers talk to Everett about his plight, Rutherford's men start an attack. Panicked, Everett and the Ferbers run for cover inside the shack. The Ferbers notice the rifles set at the windows in firing position but no one else available to man them. They realize that it was a ruse employed by Everett to make any unwanted visitor believe that inside the shack there are many armed men. Because his secret is now revealed to his guests, Everett refuses to allow them to leave, believing they will betray his secret ruse to Rutherford's men. Despite assurances from the Ferbers that they will not reveal Everett's ruse to Rutherford's men, Everett refuses to let them go. Besides, they all are under attack by Rutherford's men who slowly are approaching the shack while unleashing a hail of bullets at the defenders. The Ferbers agree to temporarily help Everett fight off Rutherford's men hoping to leave the area later-on during the night. During the ensuing battle, Rutherford and his son are mortally wounded, while many mercenaries are killed by dynamite explosions from hidden booby-traps previously buried in the sand by Everett. Rutherford orders a retreat to the camp to regroup and assess the loses. In the camp he decides to quit, arguing that a small piece of land lost to one solitary squatter isn't worth the loss of lives. However, his usually calm bookkeeper, Mr. Avery, insists to continue the forced-eviction campaign. A dying Rutherford refuses to listen to Avery, reminding Avery that it's Rutherford's property and Rutherford is still in charge. Avery aggravates Rutherford by placing himself in-charge of the campaign and arguing that Rutherford is not fit to command anymore. He also observes that Rutherford will die soon and he will be unable to order his hired men to quit and go home. Enraged by Avery's words, Rutherford exits his tent to give his last orders to his men to disperse but he dies before he has a chance to do so. Avery declares himself in-charge of the campaign and tells the men to call him General and obey his orders. When the foreman, Hook, mocks Avery's orders, Avery shoots one of the men dead. Afraid of a mad Avery, the men reluctantly agree to call him General and obey his orders. Avery makes Hook his second-in-command and promises a rich gold reward to him and to the men if they obey. Now, with a more dangerous man in-charge of the eviction campaign, the squatter Everett and his guests, the Ferbers, are in serious trouble.

Documentary	The film's subject is murder; its heroes are seven ordinary men and women who committed such an act. The House of Cain plunges into the people's images, memories, nightmares and reality, as well as their attempts to escape from the borderline situation in which they live. In his own way, each one of the characters -six prison inmates, their guard and one former prisoner- encircle the irrevocable act, which embodies the absurd and crushes their existence. The prison, the morgue, the museum of criminal exhibits, the courts, the police, the ruins of an old penal colony, prison cells yet to be built, the streets in the city - all constitute the mournful route of the perpetrator, the mournful route of the main characters of this film, but also of the still unknown people, who may, at any given time, equally unexpectedly, find themselves in the same position. The events, the intimate details are absent. The House of Cain is a journey in human decline and the guilt that each person experiences in the way and to the degree that he can. The film is a silent lament, humble and awkward for a lost innocence. Whether that can be regained is open to question. It is an exploration of man's limits but also of the boundaries of the documentary genre using the acrobatics of the characters and the acrobatics of style. It is the reality of the soul and the senses as the only cinematic reality and record.

Shiley, an avid world traveler, was personally driven to travel to Iraq and produce a documentary film about what was happening behind the scenes. Although Shiley is not a journalist, he convinced local television affiliate KATU in Portland, OR, to grant him permission to cover the Oregon National Guard in Iraq. Shiley still needed press credentials, so he went to his local Kinko's print shop where he ingeniously made a homemade press pass. He then cashed in airline miles and with a single contact name written on a crumpled piece of paper, crossed into Iraq-setting off on a journey that would change his life forever. Armed only with a camera and a local guide, Shiley traveled throughout the country of Iraq for two months, filming unique stories the national media ignores, showing the reality of life in Iraq beyond the media and military spin. Rather than trying to push a political point of view, Shiley let his camera roll, catching a multitude of real-life moments that tell it like it is.

Documentary	An apocryphal view on the pyramids, starting in awe at the amazing achievement of the Pharanoic architecture and sculpture, most specially at Gizeh, given Cheops's pyramid's size, weight, incredibly precise carving, four pairs of slightly shifted half sides, stunningly precisely measured shapes and symmetry. Then it questions and challenges conventional Egyptology beliefs, which it calls unproven or even impossible to verify, such as the absence of machines, a wharf duration of only 20 years or accidental equinox-orientation. Next it elaborates the theory that other major pyramid technology sites in Precolombian America, Easter Island and China can't coincidentally lie on two lines intersecting at Gizeh, even if not contemporaneous and without known contacts in their ages, and have several improbable things in common, like some of their cultures. Elaborate mathematical theories and measurements indicate the Egyptians must have known some astronomy, pi and the golden number, maybe even the meter, and such knowhow may have been secretly passed on. The makers conclude the most logical explanation is an older, wiped-out civilization, which may well have tried to warn us for the apocalyptic trouble that wiped them out, possibly starting with the present climatic crisis.

Documentary	Using Goethe's Theory of Colours (Zur Farbenlehre) as point of departure, Light Darkness and Colours takes us on a fascinating journey through the universe of colours. In 1704, Sir Isaac Newton published *Light and Refraction*, his study of the interactions between sunlight and prisms. Newton was, as a good scientist, intent on achieving objectivity, which meant studying sunlight in isolation. He thought colours were contained solely in light, and found the spectrum he was looking for. When he reproduced this experiment, Goethe found another, hidden set of colours missed by Newton. Goethe found the hidden colours in the boundaries between light and darkness. He felt, as an artist, that one could not talk about light without including darkness. Calling it 'the light-darkness polarity', Goethe made this new scientific discovery using artistic methods in conjunction with science. As far as scientists were concerned, Goethe was a layman, which meant that his research went largely ignored. Not until many years later was it recognized how revolutionary his scientific discoveries really were. Goethe spent more than 40 years of his life on *Zur Farbenlehre*, which in its own way summarizes the whole of his thinking and connects his poetry with science. Goethe himself viewed his work as so stunningly radical that he prophesied that it would only be understood generations after his death. In keeping with Goethe's method, the three directors work from a personal curiosity as they explore the natural laws and phenomena surrounding human sensory perception. Using strikingly beautiful time-lapse cinematography, and duplicating Goethe's and Newton's experiments on camera, they have crafted a visually stunning and intellectually rewarding film.

This event so transformed him that Lonnie became an itinerant Christian evangelist, something of a John the Baptist of Southern California who compelled thousands of fellow spiritual seekers to make a profession of faith in Jesus Christ. During the 1970s Lonnie Frisbee became widely known as California's "hippie preacher," the quintessential "Jesus freak" whose pictures frequented such magazines as Time and Life as the media told the story of a burgeoning "Jesus movement." Lonnie Frisbee provided the charismatic spark that launched the Calvary Chapel church into a worldwide ministry and propelled many fledgling leaders into some of the most powerful movers and shakers of the evangelical movement.

And gangster runners want to make it in the gangster world. In the eyes of the authorities, he is an "intensive offender"; in his own eyes, Yehya is "one of the top ten of Neukölln. I got my own prosecutor!" Yehya: the son of Palestinian refugees from Lebanon, a Rütli school student with straight Fs - and a jailbird doing time. At the age of 17, Yehya was convicted of robbery and sentenced to three years without parole. The director Christian Stahl followed Yehya through the years in prison and, at the same time, his family in Neukölln. The viewer is there as Yehya's image of the world and gangsterism wobbles, as he quickly goes up the ladder in prison hierarchy, as he turns to Islam, and as he suddenly himself becomes a victim while in prison. His father tries to solve the family problems with a pilgrimage to Mecca, Yehya's brothers follow in his footsteps, and the government wants to deport Yehya or send him back to the refugee camp in Beirut. His parents, who as refugees in Germany were not allowed to work for 14 years and stayed in their own world, are in despair. Gangster runner presents an impressive portrait of an "intensive offender" whose charm, criminal energy, and reflexivity astound and shock. Between Muslim traditions and gangster dreams, macho image and mosque, the ever-present war in the foreign homeland of the parents and the battle to survive in Europe.

A free spirit and multifaceted individual, he was far ahead of his time and has since become a seminal figure, a symbol of hope for a free Tibet. A rebel and voluble critic of the establishment, Gendun Choephel kindled the anger of the Tibetan authorities. The cinematic journey through time portrays the life of this unorthodox monk, revealing a face of old Tibet that goes against popular clichés. The film makes an abundance of unique and rare historical footage available to the general public for the first time.

Archival images of ancient caravans and monasteries give way to scenes of discos and multi-lane highways in Lhasa, where pilgrims prostrate themselves as they circle the holy temple. ANGRY MONK offers a fascinating insight into a country whose eventful past is refracted in the multiplicity and contradictions of everyday life. Ultimately, this road movie also tells the story of a man who left home to search for something that could have liberated traditional Tibet from its rigidity. An outsider who was always open to new things, he eventually became a stranger in his homeland and homeless in foreign lands - a wanderer between worlds.

Documentary	After recording over 650 songs, appearing in 39 feature films and appearing in 75 hours of television, Doris Day retired a bona fide superstar. Since her retirement, she has led an extremely private life in Carmel-by-the-Sea, California, with her multitude of animals, and being a partner in a local hotel, without feeling a need to accomplish anything else in the entertainment business despite probably still being able to do so at age 85, and despite legions of fans who would like to see her in show business again. Born Doris Mary Ann Kappelhoff in rather humble beginnings in 1922 Cincinnati, Doris came by her musical talents naturally being the daughter of a choral director and musician. Although destined at an early age to become a dancer, a car accident sustained at age 13 abruptly brought those dreams to an end. During that time, she began to hone her singing craft, being a songstress for which she is probably best known today. She made a name for herself as such especially with Les Brown's band. Her singing career took a natural course into motion pictures, especially in movie musicals. Michael Curtiz, the director of her first movie, saw in her screen test what most movie goers love about her: her naturalness. Day herself is aware that her public persona is of the virginal girl next door, which is in contrast to a somewhat turbulent private life, which includes four marriages - some less than happy - bankruptcy, and an association with the Charles Manson murders at the home of her son, Terry Melcher. In some respects, her acting career took an appropriate end with the Vietnam War and Watergate eras bringing to the entertainment field more gritty movie portrayals not generally associated with the name Doris Day.

Documentary	Water is essential to existence. Our bodies require it, as do our souls. It is the stuff of life and death, of sweat and tears, of need and wonder. Water bubbles through our imaginations, splashes through our forms of play and winds through the tributaries of human spirituality. Yet, as precious as we know water is, we have treated it as if it were infinite and cheap, which has led to an international crisis of epic proportions. One Water is a film that celebrates all the myriad ways water has touched human lives around the globe and explores our changing relationship to water as it grows ever more perilously scarce. The film leaves audiences with a series of provocative questions that culminate in one that will impact all of our futures: is water a human right or a commodity? Through a starkly emotional journey, the audience is invited to bear witness and encouraged to recognize this major global crisis as his or her very own. Filmed in 15 countries in both hemispheres, One Water churns together stirring visual sequences, compelling expert commentary, hypnotic local music and a score performed by the world-renowned Russian National Orchestra to immerse audiences in a direct and exhilarating experience of the meaning of water to humanity.

In Africa and Hungary, the tale of how water washes through daily spiritual life and moments of bliss is explored.

Documentary	At age 18, Barack Obama admittedly arrived at Occidental College a committed revolutionary Marxist. What was the source of Obama's foundation in Marxism? Throughout his 2008 Presidential campaign and term in office, questions have been raised regarding Barack Obama's family background, economic philosophy, and fundamental political ideology. Dreams from My Real Father is the alternative Barack Obama "autobiography," offering a divergent theory of what may have shaped our 44th President's life and politics. In Dreams from My Real Father, Barack Obama is portrayed by a voiceover actor who chronicles Barack Obama's life journey in socialism, from birth through his election to the Presidency. The film begins by presenting the case that Barack Obama's real father was Frank Marshall Davis, a Communist Party USA propagandist who likely shaped Obama's world view during his formative years. Barack Obama sold himself to America as the multi-cultural ideal, a man who stood above politics. Was the goat herding Kenyan father only a fairly tale to obscure a Marxist agenda, irreconcilable with American values? This fascinating narrative is based in part on 2 years of research, interviews, newly unearthed footage and photos, and the writings of Davis and Obama himself. Dreams of My Real Father weaves together the proven facts with reasoned logic in an attempt to fill-in the obvious gaps in Obama's history. Is this the story Barack Obama should have told, revealing his true agenda for "fundamentally transforming America?" Director Joel Gilbert concludes, "To understand Obama's plans for America, the question is not 'Where's the Birth Certificate?,' the question is 'Who is the real father?'"
Documentary	Branwen Okpako's The Education of Auma Obama is a captivating and intimate portrait of the U.S. president's older half-sister, who embodies a post-colonial, feminist identity. An academic overachiever, she studied linguistics and contemporary dance in Heidelberg, Germany, before enrolling in film school in Berlin, where she met Nigerian-born director Okpako in the nineties. After living in the United Kingdom for a short period, Auma Obama eventually moved back to Kenya to mentor a young generation of community activists, social workers and other ambitious young men and women who lacked her privileged education and training, but were nonetheless determined to make a positive contribution to their society. Okpako has always been interested in questions of identity, affiliation and belonging. Although she frames her film as a biographical portrait of Obama, she goes much further, providing a layered historical context and discussions of post-colonial African identity from a feminist perspective. Okpako collects testimonies almost exclusively from women, echoing the African tradition of women as chroniclers of oral history. When coupled with these accounts, Okpako's use of archival footage - filmed during colonization for an entirely different purpose - offers a new reading of history and the present. Obama is also the daughter of a charismatic man who fought for the liberation of his country and participated in the shaping of the first years of independence. She witnessed his hopefulness and rise as well as his disillusionment and demise, coming into adulthood as her country - and continent - fell prey to despotism, corruption and poverty. The Education of Auma Obama is also a film about a generation of politically and socially engaged Africans whose aspirations are informed by their parents' experiences, and whose ambition to forge a better future for their communities starts from the ground up

Documentary	The film starts as a journey by the two directors-protagonists. Olga and Andrei, on the two sides of the frontline during the Russian-Georgian was in August 2008. A film on such a hot political (and geopolitical) subject first of all establishes emotional contact with the audience by depicting human drama, before coming up with political conclusions. They emerge naturally and powerfully as overwhelming evidence of Russian imperialist plot shows through the Russian media smokescreen as well as mistakes and naivety of the Georgians. The filmmakers return to their St. Petersburg studio loaded with unique footage and evidence which they analyze in the process of film-editing. This process is intertwined in the film's narrative and the viewer gets a sense of partaking in it. In this way the filmmakers are able to come to forceful conclusions without slipping into propaganda and prejudice that charachterize too many films about the August war. Importantly the film puts the recent war in context of the post-Soviet history which has managed to keep its darkest secrets away from the international public's attention despite dozens of relevant UN resolutions. At the same time as Milosevic was earning the reputation of the biggest evil of the post-communist world, Russia was sponsoring and conducting the campaign of terror and ethnic cleansing against the Georgian population of integral parts of Georgia, with cruelty exceeding that of the war in former Yugoslavia.

Afterwards, conversations with the Focan family led me to realize that despite the massive intention for research and observation regarding the topic, the project was yet an orphan. In a country with limited archives, calling the oral history-based project a daring "Turkish Jazz History" would be beyond me, so I decided to name it Jazz in Turkey instead. We started filming in 2011. The greatest hindrance for an oral history project, I suppose, is the potential of the interviewees getting lost in the turbulent waters that range between deep modesty and high ego when talking about themselves. Turkey's jazz story, which I compiled from interviews with 50 people, partially carries elements of a chronological history documentary. However, due to the interviewees' approach and what they delivered, I started evaluating it as "the impact of jazz music to Turkey." When this impact is attributed to a sociological development process, one can easily notice the structure evolving in phases. The codes involved in the process are political manoeuvres, mimicry, original advancements, technical development, social perception, determinant self-confidence and artistic spirit. I think, this documentary's mission is to voice a sincere "interpretation" of how outright facts are perceived in different social strata, rather than revealing buried historical truth. A sincere "interpretation" that pours from the minds and hearts of dozens of people... Jazz in Turkey is easily the first product in cinema format on this subject, which also covers then-broadcasted TV and radio shows. I am aware of the obsession with saying something is "a first in Turkey." However rather than concentrating on its "first"ness, what motivates me more is wishing that it will not be the "last."

Documentary	"The Most Dangerous Man in America" is the story of what happens when a former Pentagon insider, armed only with his conscience, steadfast determination, and a file cabinet full of classified documents, decides to challenge an "Imperial" Presidency-answerable to neither Congress, the press, nor the people-in order to help end the Vietnam War. In 1971, Daniel Ellsberg shook America to its foundations when he smuggled a top-secret Pentagon study to the New York Times that showed how five Presidents consistently lied to the American people about the Vietnam War that was killing millions and tearing America apart. President Nixon's National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger called Ellsberg "the most dangerous man in America," who "had to be stopped at all costs." But Ellsberg wasn't stopped. Facing 115 years in prison on espionage and conspiracy charges, he fought back. Ensuing events surrounding the so-called Pentagon Papers led directly to Watergate and the downfall of President Nixon, and hastened the end of the Vietnam War. Ellsberg's relentless telling of truth to power, which exposed the secret deeds of an "Imperial Presidency," inspired Americans of all walks of life to forever question the previously-unchallenged pronouncements of its leaders. "The Most Dangerous Man in America" tells the inside story, for the first time on film, of this pivotal event that changed history and transformed our nation's political discourse. It is told largely by the players of that dramatic episode-Ellsberg, his colleagues, family and critics; Pentagon Papers authors and government officials; Vietnam veterans and anti-war activists; Watergate principals, attorneys and the journalists who both covered the story and were an integral part of it; and finally-through White House audiotapes-President Nixon and his inner circle of advisors.

Documentary	In a fortified, explosion-proof bunker of the German Federal Archives Vault, 2000 film reels made of celluloid and the highly flammable nitrocellulose, stay protected and meticulously organised in two rows of 1000 reels each. They are the silent witnesses of a bygone era when more than 1200 films were produced under the Nazi regime, depicting a wide array of diverse topics ranging from chest-thumping musicals to anti-Semitic propaganda and melodramas about euthanasia itself. Up to the present time, in Germany, there still exists an ongoing censorship for about 40 films of the Third Reich that were made under the supervision of Joseph Goebbels' ministry of propaganda. Even though some can be concerned as absurd and blatant in our modern societies, they are deemed as dangerous and can be viewed only in special screenings under the presence of an expert, because they can still establish stereotypes to unaware audiences. Without a single doubt, some of those films are actually very well made, yet, disturbingly effective with their minute hints and insinuations cleverly hidden throughout the movie, proving Goebbels' belief that film not only is the means to educate the youth but also the most important part of propaganda. With the help of distinct experts and German film historians, this documentary attempts to provide its viewers with enough stimuli on the debate about the controversial subject of censorship as well as the inner conflict about where one draws the line on such a delicate matter.
Documentary	Haiti. Uden title is a kaleidoscopic, dramatic documentary from this chaotic Caribbean country and comprises a mixture of material on video, 16 mm and 35 mm, dating in some scenes right back shooting on Leth's Udenrigskorrespondent (1982). The very lively hand-held video sequences that make up the most recent material make up the bulk of the film and the rapid, fragmentary editing style garnished with neat video tricks, gunfire, etc. put the film at the same level as the Haiti chaos itself. The French photographer Chantal Regnault plays Leth's role as the "experiencer", an observer in the midst of the dramatic reality of Haiti which she also describes with an outsider's fascination. The film contains a large number of very powerful, sensual pictures of life and death in Haiti, the heartrending weeping at the funerals, mountains of refuse picturesquely and infernally aflame, the dramatic manifestations and ritual beauty of voodoo, the rhetoric of the politicians, and far more besides. Another angle is pursued in the scenes of the American soldier stationed there who clearly represents the impotence of western rationalism in the face of Haitian reality. But there are also great contrasts: in perfectly calm passages the tropical rain pours down on the Hotel Oloffson garden in lingering shots, lightly-attired women was clothes in a river, and a naked woman poet recites one of her poems draped in a basket chair as the camera slowly zooms in on her. Shots of a naked black woman on a white sheet offer highly personal erotic material that is also displayed during the film in ultra-brief, hidden pictures. Haiti. Uden title is thus a dynamic, vigorous visual narrative aesthetically akin to a number of contemporary documentaries such as Tómas Gislason's Fra hjertet til hånden (a portrait film about Leth) and Jacob Thuesen's Under New York.

Documentary	An extension of The Perfect Human, Good and Evil is a longer, more expansive pseudo-documentary portrayal of life, no less. Using capacious titles or chapter headings that Leth's narrator's voice dwells upon and impresses upon us as he toys with the cliché "Faces", "Bodies", "Things", "Necessary actions", "Unnecessary actions", Good thoughts", "Bad thoughts", "Pleasant feelings", "Unpleasant feelings", and "Words" - the film consist of aesthetically titillating and contentually almost schematic scenes shot in the void of the film studio: faces, bodies and things. A man with a shoe. Another man with a hardboiled egg which he talks about and eats. A woman gives her husband a shirt. A couple who argue. A desperate woman. And so forth. There is no psychological shading of the characters, merely a series of sketches or examples that are as if plucked out of different everyday contexts. The thread leading back to Life in Denmark is thus also clear. The dialogue is sparse and phrases or fragments of phrases recur, spoken by different actors and in different roles, which may be viewed as an accentuation of the ordinariness of these little utterances and as an awareness of language as such. Besides the professional cast work the film uses several photographic models, the circus artiste Diana Benneweis, and the cyclist ole Ritter, who all pose in front of the camera in small tableaux. In addition to the craziness of the project the film also contains a series of zany comic acts with Claus Nissen to carry them. He bursts into song while washing his hands, dances in an empty room, plays rhythmic games with the statement "Bossa nova rhythms I have nothing against" and repeats his mysterious closing line from The Perfect Human: "Today, too, I had an experience ..." The framework for the scenes is made up of a couple of visual leitmotifs by way of house fronts and landscapes. In addition a beautiful travelling shot from an avenue at dramatically appropriate moments is accompanied by one of the two tunes by Gunner Møller Pedersen from the film, sung in a girlish voice by Sanne Salomonsen. In 1999 Lars von Trier chose the film to represent Danish cinema at a number of European film festivals over a period of three years ("15 x 15: European Cinema Heritage").

Documentary	A Face, a Tag Line, an Invention. Two facets that don't seem to belong to the same woman. A Hollywood star as an ingenious inventor piques our curiosity. The director Georg Misch is interested in how truth and myth intertwine. He listens to stories about her told by people who knew her. He dissects the history of the woman with the exotic eroticism who not only made surprising and daring decisions in her private life, but who caused a sensation with an intrepid film project right from the start. What is left? her first film Ecstasy with its scandalous nude scenes, movies that nobody has seen or heard of, a sixty-year-old son who is still struggling with his relationship to his mother, an invention whose patent ran out too soon, so that what has become a cornerstone for wireless communications, which are in constant use in our everyday lives, brought its inventor late fame but never earned her any money. At the end of the day what lingers is the echo of her fascinating beauty. The way the film handles the archive material from various sources reflects the inner conflicts of a Hollywood diva whose other talent as a mathematical genius and inventor was not allowed to unfold so as not to endanger her aura as a successful goddess of the silver screen. As we peel away the convolution of myths that grew up about her while she was still alive what gradually emerges is the portrait of a modern woman beyond the Hollywood star. In the last decades of her life the telephone became her only means of communication with the outside world, even with her children and close friends. She often talked up to six or seven hours a day on the phone, but she hardly spent any time with anyone in person in her final years. For this reason, though also of course because of the significance of her invention to modern communications, the telephone has been chosen as the "structuring motif" of the movie. The interviews in the movie have been staged as telephone calls and lead the viewer through time like a nostalgic conference with the film's protagonists. Calling Hedy Lamarr isn't, however, a portrait; it is above all a film about the Hollywood diva from the perspective of her son Anthony Loder, a fairly successful telephone dealer in Los Angeles who wants desperately to be the Hollywood producer of a feature film about the life of his mother. Through his research he encounters contradictory statements and fantastic theories. There is often only a fine line between truth and lie. Many times the conversations between him and the other protagonists shift and take on a magical aspect, and in a supernatural way Hedy Lamarr sometimes even seems to join in. The Hollywood diva's purported schizophrenia is expressed dramaturgically as a persistent shifting between the extremes of her character and is a strong pattern in the film. The meaning of truth must be constantly reinterpreted. Lamarr's death in February 2000 marked the end of one of the most complex Hollywood biographies of the last century. The film ends where Hedy Lamarr's story began: in Vienna. In her will she asks that her ashes be strewn in the Vienna Woods. A homecoming she always dreamed of but which she never managed to make during her lifetime.

Western	In this Charles Starrett western that WAS NOT produced by Peter B. Kyne and was solely written by Ford Bebee, although some sources attribute the story to Peter B. Kyne because, with his permission and as a selling angle, the title shown on the film and all of the posters is "Peter B. Kyne's CODE OF THE RANGE." The use of his name was Mr. Kyne's only contribution. Ford Beebe's "original screenplay" (he had used it before) finds the cattlemen, headed by "Calamity" Parker, opposing the use of their range lands by sheep herders, with cattlemen Lee Jamison and Ed Randall in the dissenting minority and they offer sheepman Angus McLeod free grazing privileges. Saloon owner Barney Ross offers to keep the sheepmen off of the range and out of town if each cattleman will pay $500. They agree after he promises there will be no bloodshed. Ross then visits bank clerk Quigley, who Ross knows has stolen bank funds to cover his gambling losses at Ross' saloon, and forces him to forge the name of bank president Adams on a foreclosure notice on Jamison's ranch. Ross then buys Jamison's property thereby making it impossible for the sheep-herders to use the land for grazing. Calamity's daughter Janet works at the bank and is engaged to Jamison but they have parted because of a quarrel over the feud. But when Jamison learns that his property has been "legally" stolen, Mary, who suspects Ross and Quigley, aids him by wiring Adams to return immediately. Jamison, suspecting that Ross will have his henchmen take Adams off the stagecoach and kill him, beats the gang to the stagecoach, takes Adams and hides him. But Jamison has to flee town when Ross tells the townsmen that Jamison took Adams off the stage and killed him. But he will return.

In this one RCMP Tim Barry (Buck Jones, who also made two Texas Rangers versions of this one), quits the RCMP (as a ruse)to cross the border from Canada to the U.S. to avenge the death of his Mountie brother at the hands of a gang led by Conyda (Fred Kohler.)

Documentary	Cooper and Hemingway: The True Gen is an unprecedented look at the bond between two of the most iconic artists of the 20th century.Utter opposites... nothing in common. The cowboy and the suburbanite. The conservative and the liberal. And yet these two artists (a word both men scoffed at) were the best of friends, right up to their deaths a mere seven weeks apart in 1961. But is the friendship of these two men really so surprising? A study of these two men is a study of the 20th century. Their internationally renowned careers (Cooper, two Best Actor Academy Awards; Hemingway, Nobel and Pulitzer Prizes) were played out over the same turbulent decades: the hedonistic 20s, the grim Depression 30s, the war-ravaged 40s, and the deceptively slumbering 50s; throughout, their public and private lives connected, parted, re-connected, intertwined, over-lapped, and collided. It is no small irony that the lives of these two men should suffer untimely ends at the dawn of the erupting sixties. Their final, poignant chapter closed at the beginning of a decade which would challenge many of the very ideals and precepts which both men so prominently represented.And yet, decades later, we have Liam Neeson reflecting: "...the character of Bryan Mills (Taken) fits into a cinematic iconic figure that we all recognize from way back ... I'm thinking of Gary Cooper in High Noon, who is kind of a Bryan Mills. That kind of iconic figure that audiences seem to be attracted to."Perhaps Cooper and Hemingway didn't really pass the torch, perhaps they merely leant it.

Documentary	On the eve of her 70th birthday, Canadian writer Margaret Atwood set out on an international tour criss-crossing the British Isles and North America to celebrate the publication of her new dystopian novel, The Year of the Flood. But rather than mount a traditional tour to promote a book's publication, Atwood conceived and executed something far more ambitious and revelatory-a theatrical version of her novel. Along the way she reinvented what a book tour could be. But Atwood wasn't selling books as much as advocating an idea. Her primary concern was to do what she could to ensure the continued life of the birds of the skies-especially song birds. Atwood's odyssey is now captured in Ron Mann's new film, In The Wake of the Flood. Rendered as a fly-on-the-wall film verite, In The Wake of the Flood mixes new footage, archival materials and evocative CGI in featuring Atwood on the road and at home as an aging but buoyant literary rock star spreading a message of warning and hope as she staged and participated in the novel production. Margaret Atwood is, of course, one of the most acclaimed literary voices of this generation. The author of more than a dozen novels, numerous collections of poetry, children's books, and countless essays, Atwood's triumphs have been lauded on the highest levels throughout the world. In each community she visited, Atwood joined volunteer performers in a loose-knit, grass roots production drawn from the text of her novel. With its mystical, Blakean overtones, Atwood's theatrical version of The Year of the Flood acts as a song cycle that seeks to shake the human race into an awareness of the fragility of the natural world and our vital connection to it. To bring her novel into a live setting, Atwood teamed with Los Angeles composer Orville Stoeber to write a new style of devotional music influenced by the related genres of country ballads, gospel, jazz and folk. Each performance included a cast of local readers and singers taking the roles of different characters in key scenes from the novel. The events were primarily staged in cathedrals, adding a grand visual element to the proceedings and a layer of ceremonial gravitas. From Edinburgh and London to New York City, Toronto and Vancouver, Atwood emerges as a wizened elf whose rare sensibility is always in the foreground: a life and art coalesced into a unity of medium and message.

When she recovers, she is hostile and claims she is Felicia and not Miranda. Dick tells Katy that Felicia was his first wife, who died in a plunge from a cliff. Miranda asks to see Mr. and Mrs. Bradley, parents of Felicia, and when she calls Ada Bradley "mother", Dick and Katy realize she is possessed by "the other one." Ada Bradley has been practicing black magic for six years and believes it is responsible for returning her dead daughter to her. Mr. Bradley, as one would expect, is horrified at both revelations, although the first one indicates he wasn't paying much attention to what his wife was doing when she was puttering around the kitchen the past few years. That night "Felicia" tries to kill Katy by flooding her room with gas, but Katy awakens in time. Both of the Bradleys suffer strokes - long odds, not impossible - that night and the old man dies while Ada is left paralyzed. The desperate "Felicia" seeks out Maitre Renall, also a black practitioner but on a grander scale than Ada Bradley, as the only person that can keep her alive. He promises to do so but only if she will make a blood sacrifice of an innocent victim. Nancy Corodell, jealous of Renall's attention to "Felicia", hears this and Renall's black magic gets tested by the hell-hath-no-fury method.

Documentary	Nobody less than the Hungarian Bela Bartok once declared: "Competitions are for horses, not artists!" Using the example of the Chopin Piano Competition in Warsaw, the documentary film "Why Competitions" looks into the question whether the competitive spirit that dominates music competitions is conformable with objective and ethical precepts, whether the prize winners actually benefit from their success and what happens to those who are often being stigmatized as "losers". This documentary film about the most important piano competition in the world was produced on the occasion of Frederic Chopins 200th birthday. It lets the participants and jury members have their say, some of who have learned to keep their distance to their experiences, yet most of them are unable to forget and accept the fact they had to suffer injustice even after 60 years. The film focuses on the scandal following the elimination of the Croatian pianist Ivo Pogorelich who did not pass to the final round at the competition in 1980, which caused the world-famous Argentinian pianist Martha Argerich to leave the jury in protest, thanks to which Pogorelich became a star overnight. 1980 also marked a turning point in Polish history: A few months before the competition began the trade union "Solidarnosc" was established. The film is divided in several chapters with each of them dealing with another competition year. In 1980 it was Pogorelich who took center stage, in 1975 the three Soviet competitors who instead of winning the competition only took 2nd, 3rd, and 4th prize were "penalized" by the Soviet Regime and thus prevented from making a career after the competition. The last chapter deals with the general question whether music competitions can be just and useful. Never before has such a wide range of world-famous musicians and eminent pedagogues spoken on this subject so candidly. With some ugly truths about corruption and bribery being revealed by these respectable persons, the question remains: Why do these people often chose to remain an integral part of the international competition circuit?

In the end, Man Long returns to the Force with a renewed understanding of what it takes to be a good actor. He transplants his new-found knowledge into the future generation of undercovers whose lives will be spared because of Man Long's acting classes.

McKean has intentions of letting Larkin complete the land deals and then he and his gang will steal the money.

Documentary	The incomparable splendor of Naples, situated in the shadow of a volcano and by the blue sea of an enormous bay, inspired Johann Wolfgang von Goethe to the famous statement: "See Naples and die". But Naples also has a more complex side. Behind the splendor and pomp that dates from the time when Naples still had great political and social influence, one can also find poverty and adversity. The film director Vincent Monnikendam ends in the backstreets and steep alleyways where sunlight barely penetrates, where dark drama and frivolity keep the age-old city in their grip. The central feature of the film is the painting The Seven Acts of Mercy by Caravaggio, the master of the clair-obscur. This altar piece was painted in 1607, commissioned by the noble founders of the Pio Monte della Misericordia, a charitable institution that is still active. Myths about this painting, the history of the Pio Monte, the joy and sorrow of Neapolitans, alternate and combine to form a colourful portrait. With a leading role for the city of Naples itself. Among the important characters in Souls of Naples are Pietro Gargano, editor-in-chief of the newspaper Il Mattino and a connoisseur of urban history, and Gian Paolo Leonetti, former chairman of the Pio Monte della Misericordia and a descendant of a noble family. The baroque interior of the villa where we meet contrasts with the sober entourage of the inner city. This is where the transsexual Gianni earns a meagre income by selling lottery tickets and Pina tells us about her difficult existence while she sews trendy handbags in a small factory located in an old cellar. The Russian painter Natalia Tsarkova tries to communicate in her own work the essence of clair-obscur in the paintings by Caravaggio whom she so admires. According to her, the special lighting effects with powerful contrasts so characteristic of his work are the symbol of survival, for good and evil, for life and death. In a style inspired by these characteristic light-dark contrasts Souls of Naples provides an inspiring portrait of a city that has survived for two and half thousand years.

Documentary	"Last Will and Embezzlement" is a feature-length documentary which examines the financial exploitation of the elderly. Its creation was inspired by the recent, true-life events in the family of Executive Producer and Starjack Entertainment partner, Pamela S. K. Glasner, and although the film does touch upon the events in Ms. Glasner's family, its focus is much more universal than that, because the problem is, without question, universal. Of all the illegal and illicit enterprises in the world, elder exploitation is among the safest and most lucrative. It is a criminal's dream. It carries the least amount of risk, requires minimal outlay, can be done right from your living room, is virtually unreported by its victims - and then, even when it IS reported, it's perpetrators are practically never prosecuted. The financial cost is staggering; the human cost is incalculable. Each and every day now, for the next 19 years, more than 11,000 Baby Boomers nationally and more than 61,000 Baby Boomers globally** will be turning 65 - and since Baby Boomers control 80% of the personal finances (as opposed to business finance), the world is about to experience the largest transfer of wealth, from one generation to the next, in human history. This quite literally exposes more than 500 million Baby Boomers, plus their already-aged parents, plus their adult children (their beneficiaries) to what will literally become a global epidemic of fraud and financial abuse if this crime-spree is left unchecked.

Drama	This is a true story about forty Jewish children on their way to Palestine, who were blocked by the German and Italian occupation of Yugoslavia in 1941. Before finding a haven at Villa Emma in Nonantola in northern Italy, where they arrived on June 17, 1942, the children spent several adventurous months in Slovenia, caught up in the ongoing fight between the partisans and the Italian army. In April 1943, another 33 children, some from the Balkans, others from France, joined the original group. All were orphans who had lost their parents in concentration camps and had subsequently been smuggled out of Germany by Recha Freier, a well-known Zionist. The group ranged in age from six to twenty one and settled in at Villa Emma with their chaperones and teachers, Josef Indig, Marco Schoky and the pianist Boris Jochverdson. The children lived in modest, but quite acceptable conditions. They attended class and courses in agriculture and craftsmanship prepared them for their impending departure for Palestine and a future on a Kibbutz. The orphans were under police supervision and forbidden to go out alone, but even so Nonantola took their plight to heart and firm friendships were established between the townspeople and the young Jews. After Italy surrendered to the Allies on September 8, 1943, German troops arrived in Nonantola and the situation changed dramatically. In less than 48 hours, Villa Emma was abandoned and the fugitive boys and girls found refuge in the seminary of the Abbey, and in the homes of local farmers, craftsman and shopkeepers. The local priest, Father Arrigo Beccari, showed great courage in these circumstances. The threat of raids by the German police provoked much anxiety and between September 28 and October 16, 1943 all the young refugees were successfully smuggled into Switzerland, fording the fast-flowing Tresa River under cover of darkness. In Switzerland, Zionist organizations hosted them in an institute in Bex in the Rodano Valley and it was from there that most of the group reached Palestine in May 1945 after an odyssey that had lasted five years. One of the boys who contracted TB and had to be admitted to a sanatorium was unable to escape and his name appears on a list of deportees to Auschwitz. Subsequently, Arrigo Beccari and Giuseppe Moreali, the local doctor in Nonantola, were cited in the Yad Vashem for their courage and they have their own tree in the Avenue of Just Men.
