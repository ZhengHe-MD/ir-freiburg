(Stoney is shown in front of two theatres where Columbia, missing no bets, has displays of one-sheet posters from "Strawberry Roan" with Gene Autry and "The Undercover Man" with Glenn Ford.) Reporter Vera Wright (Jeff Donnell), following him to get a story of a failure, informs Stoney that he is a never-was has-been, and they find themselves stranded in the hometown of Eddy Arnold, where Eddy's film "cousin" Carolina Cotton (Carolina Cotton) quickly takes a shine to the shy and clumsy Stoney. Eddy sees a print of Stoney's film in which the character is singing "I Can't Shake the Sands of Texas From My Shoes" and is impressed and telephones his agent Sam Baker (Fred Sears) to come there quickly and sign Stoney to a contract, especially since he sounds like Gene Autry. Meanwhile, some bank robbers and gangsters get involved and have their eyes on the proceeds from a charity fund-raiser Eddy is doing. When the agent shows up to sign Stoney to a recording contract because "you sound like Gene Autry", Stoney says that is because it was Gene Autry doing the singing in the film. The film is somewhat of an inside joke built around ace stuntman Mahoney, in that his Stoney role is the opposite of his real-life abilities, and most of the males in the cast, Big Boy Williams, Douglas Fowley, Don Harvey and Charles Sullivan, takes turns beating him up and knocking him out...when he isn't falling out of hay lofts or involved in accidents. But a kiss from Carolina makes a new man out of him and the gangsters are rounded up in a one-man blitz, and Stoney ends up with eight studios bidding for his services. Eddy performs most of his best-selling hits of the day, with the exception of "Cattle Call", the vastly-underrated Carolina Cotton (as a performer and actress with a personality) yodels up a storm, and this overall turns out to be a pretty fair little sleeper, especially in regards to films where Hollywood takes a poke at itself.And probably unknown to those who go around compiling such lists.

Documentary	An anti-war film about the personal suffering behind the hard statistics, which show that more than four million Vietnamese died during the Vietnam War, as opposed to 58,000 Americans. We hear South and North Vietnamese, including √©migr√©s to the United States, describing how huge numbers of friends met their deaths, caught as they were between government forces, the Vietcong, and the Americans; how political boundaries divided not only the country, but also families; how mothers deserted their children because their fathers were American soldiers; and how the war cruelly lingers on long after hostilities ceased, in the lives of children born crippled by chemical weapons. The talking heads' stories are underpinned by family photos of friendly, smiling Vietnamese in uniform that contrast shrilly with the sometimes extremely horrific archive footage of bombardments and battlefields. The aural backdrop of modern soundscapes and music make the stories chillingly easy to identify with. Occasionally, a commentary provides some background information, but basic knowledge about the parties involved is assumed. The film gives equal attention to the stories of both men and women, particularly those in the Vietnamese resistance.

Documentary	In continuation of the time trial sequence from Stars and Watercarriers, The Impossible Hour is a concentrated study of Ole Ritter's attempt in Mexico City in 1974 to set a new record for the hour - described in the film as "the noblest, most difficult record that can be set on a bicycle". A brief retrospective in black and white sets the historical framework, with shots of Ritter and Eddy Merckx' successful record attempts in 1968 and 1972 respectively, and a few words about former record holders such as Fausto Coppi. From then on the film is in colour and with one minor exception (a training scene from a motor race track) it takes place in the relatively colourless setting of a cycle track. The film follows Ritter's three record attempts chronologically, which, accompanied by a Mexican marching band on the bandstand, all fail. There are several interview situations in hand-held reportage style in which Ritter is surrounded by a group of reporters and gives his account of the attempts, plus other shots from the inner circle of the cycle track. When Ritter is riding he is captured from a motorcycle moving round the track or we follow him (during the record attempts) in long pans all the way round the track. The only notable visual device is the slow motion used to accentuate Ritter's style in a couple of places, accompanied by a piano theme, with Leth's words on the soundtrack: "The functional mastery of power is an aesthetic experience". Throughout the film Leth talks soberly and informatively about cycling technique, the advantages of the thin air in Mexico City, Ritter's gradual acquisition of his average speed and rhythm, the progress of the record attempts, etc.

Documentary	The current method of raw food production is largely a response to the growth of the fast food industry since the 1950s. The production of food overall has more drastically changed since that time than the several thousand years prior. Controlled primarily by a handful of multinational corporations, the global food production business - with an emphasis on the business - has as its unwritten goals production of large quantities of food at low direct inputs (most often subsidized) resulting in enormous profits, which in turn results in greater control of the global supply of food sources within these few companies. Health and safety (of the food itself, of the animals produced themselves, of the workers on the assembly lines, and of the consumers actually eating the food) are often overlooked by the companies, and are often overlooked by government in an effort to provide cheap food regardless of these negative consequences. Many of the changes are based on advancements in science and technology, but often have negative side effects.The products made have been shown in several studies to enlarge male sexual organs and increase male breast size. The answer that the companies have come up with is to throw more science at the problems to bandage the issues but not the root causes. The global food supply may be in crisis with lack of biodiversity, but can be changed on the demand side of the equation.

Documentary	Amina Filali is a 16-year old Moroccan girl who committed suicide after being forced to marry her alleged rapist. Her tragic death dominated Moroccan and international media in March 2012. Amina had accused a young man in her village of rape, but because authorities failed to properly investigate her accusations, she was married to her rapist following a citation from article 475 of the Moroccan penal code. This article dismisses a rapist of his charges as long as he marries his victim. A year after her marriage, Amina swallowed rat poison, walked into the village market, and died. Through this horrifying affair, the film explores the legal, political, religious and social issues that plague Moroccan women - chipping away at the facade of equality that disguises a deep-seated patriarchal system. Underscoring the pervasiveness of this problem, the team filming 475 also discovers that Filali's rape and marriage was only one of four similar incidents that had happened in her small village's recent memory. They also discover that the account of Filali's experience was not as simple as it had been portrayed. While the film highlights the difficulty in determining guilt, it also adeptly showcases the endemic nature of the problem of sexual violence in Morocco.

Documentary	"Degenerate Art" is a true document of the art and culture of glass pipe-making. It is the first film to ever bring to light this invisible sub-culture in a comprehensive and well informed format. The film itself tells the story of the movement through the voices of the pipe makers themselves and the industry that surrounds them. "Degenerate Art" tells the story of glass pipe-making from Bob Snodgrass and the origins of the "color-changing" pipe, to the radical emerging art movement it has become today. Despite federal laws and events like Operation Pipe dreams, pipe makers are pioneering not only new techniques in working glass, but have also created a whole new genre of American folk art. Between raw materials and glass working tools, and consumer demand for glass pipes, a huge multi-million dollar industry has formed around this taboo culture. The pieces not only reflect the artists making them, they are a reaction to the status quo. The work itself challenges our right to free speech and expression, as well as reflecting the nature of the people who make and collect the pieces. One of the last true underground scenes, glass pipe art remains invisible to mainstream culture. "Degenerate Art" will be the first of its kind, a historical instant cult classic documenting the golden era of the movement.

Documentary	In 1984 J√∏rgen Leth, cinematographer Dan Holmberg and sound recordist Niels Torp travelled some 6,000 kilometres by train through China. The result is a very calm, beautifully perceived travelogue borne by unprejudiced curiosity and observational ability. A riverboat in a landscape of sugar-top mountains in Southern China and the many shots from the train journey are the visual leitmotifs of the film, in which we meet an acrobat, a painter in inks, some opera students from the Beijing conservatory, and a group of female racing cyclists. The camera falls in love with exquisite tai chi movements and the dexterity of the train kitchen staff, and the soundtrack gives a vivid sense of the noisy life on board, with music blaring from scratchy loudspeakers. The fact that the film should be viewed as a collection of notes on film, i.e. a kind of travel journal, is emphasised by the title and by Leth's only words on the soundtrack: "I take notes because I want to remember what I have seen. I am smoking a Chinese cigarette and I am travelling on board a train in China". (In an English version of the film, which is nineteen minutes shorter, a further three notes appear on the soundtrack).

Documentary	Died Young, Stayed Pretty is a candid look at the underground poster culture in North America. This unique documentary examines the creative spirit that drives these indie graphic artists. They pick through the dregs of America's schizophrenic culture and piece them back together. What you end up with is a caricature of the black and bloated heart that pulses greed through the US economy. The artists push further into the pulp to grab the attention of passersby, plastering art that's both vulgar and intensely visceral onto the gnarled surfaces of the urban landscape. The film gives us intimate look at some of the giants of this modern subculture. Outside of their own circle, they're virtually unknown. But within their ranks they make up an army of bareknuckle brawlers, publicly arguing the aesthetic merits of octopus imagery and hairy 70s porn stars. They've created their own visual language for describing the spotty underbelly of western civilization and they're not shy about throwing it in the face of polite society. Along the way, they manage to create posters that are strikingly obscene, unflinchingly blasphemous and often quite beautiful. Yaghoobian shows these artists for what they are: the vivisectionists of America's morbidly obese consumer culture.

Documentary	Traberg, like Udenrigskorrespondenten, is an experiment in fiction consisting of placing a character or a fictional sketch into a set of surroundings and seeing what happens. Moreover, for most of the film the surroundings are the same, namely the chaotic reality of Haiti. Ebbe Traberg plays Traberg, a mystical character who cannot be explained psychologically and whose seemingly covert activities care only hinted at in pictures. We follow him from a could of locations in Northern Spain (which the genuine Traberg was attached to, including the pelotafront√≥ns of the Pays Basques) to Haiti, where the film changes character. A narrator comes clean right from the start: "I didn't know where it would lead me. It was this thing about my old friend Traberg. I wanted to tell a simple story. But it was harder than I thought". The difficulty with the fictional story is that the genuine events (a military coup and the inauguration of Jean-Bertrand Aristide as president in 1991) are so intrusive that the narrator pretty much loses interest in Traberg and works in a hectic documentary style instead, although in the closing shots a resolution of the Traberg story is hinted at. The film also contains several detached scenes from Haiti, including sensual, dark dance shots, a series of adages pronounced by an elderly gentleman, conveyed by fading up and down, a girl bringing cocktails for the film crew at the Hotel Oloffsen, etc. This material points clearly forward in time to Haiti.

Western	20th Century-Fox, concentrating on their own CinemaScope films and therby not making enough films to meet their release needs, went outside to independent film makers to make up for the studio's output, and the consequences was that director/producer names such as Wesley Barry and Edward L. Alperson (on this one) and the likes of Sig 'n Sam Neufeld/Newfield on others, found their names, to the surprise of probably themselves and certainly to the film-going public, on screen behind the 20th Century-Fox logo. No matter the reason or how it was packaged, a whole lot of B-dross, minus the production values the studio usually managed to disguise their own in-house dross with, begin to appear. This one has Jess Raidley (Bill Williams), not-ready-to-quit henchman of retired outlaw Jim Dalton (Nelson Leigh), carrying on with business as usual.
