Documentary	An extension of The Perfect Human, Good and Evil is a longer, more expansive pseudo-documentary portrayal of life, no less. Using capacious titles or chapter headings that Leth's narrator's voice dwells upon and impresses upon us as he toys with the cliché "Faces", "Bodies", "Things", "Necessary actions", "Unnecessary actions", Good thoughts", "Bad thoughts", "Pleasant feelings", "Unpleasant feelings", and "Words" - the film consist of aesthetically titillating and contentually almost schematic scenes shot in the void of the film studio: faces, bodies and things. A man with a shoe. Another man with a hardboiled egg which he talks about and eats. A woman gives her husband a shirt. A couple who argue. A desperate woman. And so forth. There is no psychological shading of the characters, merely a series of sketches or examples that are as if plucked out of different everyday contexts. The thread leading back to Life in Denmark is thus also clear. The dialogue is sparse and phrases or fragments of phrases recur, spoken by different actors and in different roles, which may be viewed as an accentuation of the ordinariness of these little utterances and as an awareness of language as such. Besides the professional cast work the film uses several photographic models, the circus artiste Diana Benneweis, and the cyclist ole Ritter, who all pose in front of the camera in small tableaux. In addition to the craziness of the project the film also contains a series of zany comic acts with Claus Nissen to carry them. He bursts into song while washing his hands, dances in an empty room, plays rhythmic games with the statement "Bossa nova rhythms I have nothing against" and repeats his mysterious closing line from The Perfect Human: "Today, too, I had an experience ..." The framework for the scenes is made up of a couple of visual leitmotifs by way of house fronts and landscapes. In addition a beautiful travelling shot from an avenue at dramatically appropriate moments is accompanied by one of the two tunes by Gunner Møller Pedersen from the film, sung in a girlish voice by Sanne Salomonsen. In 1999 Lars von Trier chose the film to represent Danish cinema at a number of European film festivals over a period of three years ("15 x 15: European Cinema Heritage").

A Jazz band plays in a brasserie in the city of Marseille. The owner, ALINE, is a Spanish thirty year old woman, who is divorced and has a son. All day her only thought revolves around her relationship with the singer of the band, BRUNO. BRUNO considers ALINE just another lover in another pub in another city. While the band is playing, MARCEL -ALINE's son- arrives. He is five years old and is eager for his mother's attention and tenderness, but all he ever gets are screams and disregard. The little boy hides in a small corner behind the bar counter to play and enjoy his dreams happily. There is a fire at the brasserie, so ALINE is forced to leave Marseille, but she does not know what to do with her life. The singer wants to start a new life in Berlin. He gives ALINE his address, and before leaving he says; "I only want to play and have a problem-free relationship". ALINE and MARCEL travel to Spain. When ALINE sees the old house and the little store where she grew up, she remembers her childhood and feels a deep pain recalling her mother. When ALINE meets her father, she lies to him about the time MARCEL is supposed to be staying with him: "It's just till I get settled". PASCUAL agrees without a reproach. S I N O P S I S At the beginning, MARCEL feels frightened because his grandfather is an unknown to him. PASCUAL seems trustworthy and smiles, and eventually a special atmosphere arises between both of them. PASCUAL's loneliness and sorrow disappear. Now he only lives for his grandchild's happiness. MARCEL finds in PASCUAL more than just a best friend -a person who takes care of him, listens to him, plays with him and wakes up love in his young heart. MARCEL's curiosity lead him to search for PASCUAL's hidden memories. The boy discovers a box full of pictures of the Spanish Civil War, his grandmother and the beach. All these things will remain in MARCEL's sub consciousness. The child is afraid of losing this world. Every day when he comes back from school, his grandfather is sleeping in his bedroom. There he rests every single day. The price: his grandfather is alive. He looks for PASCUAL's breath, with his mouth open. His grandfather and MARCEL breathe at the same time. It is not just air what he breaths in, it is his grandfather's dream. MARCEL wakes up, now he is eighteen. He works at the store every morning. Hardly nobody ever buys anything there. A banker makes an offer to buy the building. In the evenings he works as a waiter in a restaurant. Loneliness returns to PASCUAL's life. For his grandchild what they experience together is not enough and all his relatives and friends have disappeared. PASCUAL notices that something strange is happening to himself -his memory begins to fail. He is embarrassed and therefore does not tell MARCEL. The relation between PASCUAL and MARCEL becomes shattered. PASCUAL gets worse: he suffers paranoia, wets himself, forgets everything and often gets lost. Finally, MARCEL takes his grandfather to the doctor. He is diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. MARCEL realizes he is losing his grandfather. Now PASCUAL's struggle for survival becomes more difficult than ever. MARCEL and his grandfather get on well again, and are very close now. The tenderness they feel for each other emerges again. MARCEL and PASCUAL see each other for the last time. In a dreamlike world, grandchild and grandfather say goodbye to each other in a beach. In this universe everything makes sense and appears like a childhood dream. After the funeral, MARCEL, sad, angry and totally lost and confused, leaves Spain and travels to Berlin looking for his mother. All ALINE's reasons for moving to Berlin have vanished quickly. Lonely, she goes on looking for something, but she is an alcoholic. MARCEL arrives at his mother's door and he finds her in a pathetic condition. For a few days, he follows her, but he hides his identity. MARCEL knocks on ALINE's door with a bottle of vodka is pleased to see someone. ALINE treats him like a lover. MARCEL does not care about his mother not recognizing him. He only wants to sleep one last night by her side. The next morning, he writes a note on a picture, puts it under the pillow and leaves the house. He returns to his Spanish town. When he arrives at the store it is rundown almost completely. He enters the store carrying gasoline in his hand, closes all doors and windows and lies on his grandfather's bed. While the house and store are on fire we hear ALINE reading her son's letter. The door to the dream opens again and MARCEL starts through the corridor where his mother and grandmother are. The latter shows him to a big room at the end of the corridor. His grandmother disappears into a big glow. Afterwards MARCEL trespasses the glow, as well. A sea appears where his grandparents are. His grandmother is wearing a red dress. She nears him. MARCEL joins them. A few moments later he meets with his mother. MARCEL wakes up abruptly and runs for his life away from the fire. Leaned on the store counter he sees his childhood disappear as in a dream. Thunder roars and it starts raining over the ashes.

With contributions from the director and the many collaborators who helped define his vision, One Who Set Forth is a compelling account of Wim Wenders' life and work.

Documentary	The fascinating complexity of high school debate gives way to a portrait of the equally complex racial and class bias of American education in Greg Whiteley's riveting documentary. Initially a portrait of top-flight debaters from well-funded, mostly white schools-like nationally ranked Sam Iola and Matt Andrews of Highland Park, Texas-the film deepens when it changes focus to Richard Funches and Louis Blackwell from Long Beach's Jordan squad. While gifted traditional debaters in their own right, the two decide to challenge the usefulness of the jargon-filled, 400-word-per-minute style of modern debate (known as "the spread") by steering their debates toward issues of personal experience and dialogue. What is the use of refining an argument, they stress, when it does not affect the reality of a person's locale and particular life? Why must individual perspective and bias be masked? For many, these questions present such a radical interpretive shift that competitors and judges crumble in front of them. Contrasting Fuches and Blackwell's attempt to challenge the system with Andrews' relentless pursuit to excel in it and win the prestigious Tournament of Champions, Whiteley deftly explores the disparities between the debaters, their styles, and their resources. Alternately inspiring and polarizing, Resolved reveals a constantly shifting sport that is as much philosophy as competition. - Travis Miles (Los Angeles Film Festival)

Documentary	Hats Off profiles the beauty and eccentricities of an extraordinary woman, 93-year-old actress Mimi Weddell. With the style and grace of Katherine Hepburn, the smoky wit and wisdom of Dorothy Parker, and her own personal philosophy, "rise above it," Mimi is truly an iconic American original, rising above the mundane and difficult confines of her own daily life to reach for the stars and fulfill her dreams. Hats Off captures the essence of this most unusual woman, named at age 90 by New York Magazine as one of the "50 Most Beautiful People in New York," whose full-time acting career began at age 65 upon the passing of her husband, and whose daily routine mocks the traditional image of old age. From grueling 14-hour days at cattle call auditions to her weekly gymnastics and dance workouts, Mimi Weddell exudes a 'can-do, will-do' attitude in the face of life's trials and tribulations, and moves through her challenges with grace, encouraging us all to be more than we are. Shot over the course of 10 years, Hats Off covers a time span when most seniors are planning their funerals and estate bequests. Instead, Hats Off follows the breathtaking pace of Weddell, a bohemian free spirit now forced to share her east side Manhattan apartment with her two more traditionally-minded grown children and a grandchild. Like most families, their relationship is complex, and the mother-daughter/mother-son dynamic adds a fascinating layer of depth to an already compelling and entertaining film. When her beloved husband Dick dies, "leaving nothing behind but bills, poor man," Mimi does what she has to do to stay afloat, even attending an audition on the way to his memorial and landing the lead role in the cult film Dracula's Last Rites, which marks the beginning of her career. Since that time, 25 years ago, Mimi has been seen in print ads for companies Louis Vuitton, Burberry, Juicy Couture, and Nike, to name a few; in photo spreads for Vanity Fair and Vogue; on TV series including Sex and the City and Law and Order; and in feature films such as: Across the Universe, Hitch, and The Purple Rose of Cairo.

Documentary	In a fortified, explosion-proof bunker of the German Federal Archives Vault, 2000 film reels made of celluloid and the highly flammable nitrocellulose, stay protected and meticulously organised in two rows of 1000 reels each. They are the silent witnesses of a bygone era when more than 1200 films were produced under the Nazi regime, depicting a wide array of diverse topics ranging from chest-thumping musicals to anti-Semitic propaganda and melodramas about euthanasia itself. Up to the present time, in Germany, there still exists an ongoing censorship for about 40 films of the Third Reich that were made under the supervision of Joseph Goebbels' ministry of propaganda. Even though some can be concerned as absurd and blatant in our modern societies, they are deemed as dangerous and can be viewed only in special screenings under the presence of an expert, because they can still establish stereotypes to unaware audiences. Without a single doubt, some of those films are actually very well made, yet, disturbingly effective with their minute hints and insinuations cleverly hidden throughout the movie, proving Goebbels' belief that film not only is the means to educate the youth but also the most important part of propaganda. With the help of distinct experts and German film historians, this documentary attempts to provide its viewers with enough stimuli on the debate about the controversial subject of censorship as well as the inner conflict about where one draws the line on such a delicate matter.

But Life hasn't had its last laugh at his expense just yet... Meanwhile, across town, a scarred and ruthless gangster is preparing to break out of jail. Unknown to either man, the two of them are almost exactly alike; and when Buster finds himself on stage in the role of a jail-bird, fact and fiction are about to get extremely confused!

Documentary	What is HIV? What is AIDS? What is being done to cure it? These questions sent Canadian filmmaker Brent Leung on a worldwide journey, from the highest echelons of the medical research establishment to the slums of South Africa, where death and disease are the order of the day. In this up-to-the-minute documentary, he observes that although AIDS has been front-page news for over 28 years, it is barely understood. Despite the great effort, time, and money spent, no cure is in sight. Born in 1980 (on the cusp of the epidemic), Leung reveals a research establishment in disarray, and health policy gone tragically off course. Gaining access to a remarkable array of the most prominent and influential figures in the field -- among them the co-discoverers of HIV, presidential advisors, Nobel laureates, and the Executive Director of UNAIDS, as well as survivors and activists -- his restrained approach yields surprising revelations and stunning contradictions. The HIV/AIDS story is being rewritten, and this is the first film to present the uncensored POVs of virtually all the major players -- in their own settings, in their own words. It rocks the foundation upon which all conventional wisdom regarding HIV/AIDS is based. If, as South African health advocate Pephsile Maseko remarks, "this is the beginning of a war...a war to reclaim our health," then House of Numbers could well be the opening salvo in the battle to bring sanity and clarity to an epidemic clearly gone awry.

María Teresa is a classroom assistant at that school, an innocent - or maybe just ignorant - mistress of ceremonies, a bystander. She is twenty years old. She started work when it was still summer and Mr. Biasutto, the chief classroom assistant, made quite clear to her at her first interview the sort of attitude she is expected to adopt with students because it would not be an easy task to arrive at what he called 'the optimum surveillance point': Always on the 'qui vive', never missing a thing, but never giving cause for alarm amongst the students. A surveillance which would pick up on everything but would never be picked up on itself. A fleeting look on the face of the pervert, or the warden, or maybe the master. But if everything is out of order -even for her-, everything is transgression. And when María Teresa, hot on the trail of the merest, possibly imaginary wisp of tobacco smoke, starts hiding in the boys lavatories to catch smokers in flagrante delicto and haul them up before the authorities, slowly morphing the whole procedure into a clandestine habit of dubious piquancy; not exactly breaking the rules but bending them willy nilly, twisting, diverting them come what may but, of course, with utter correctness and obeisance to a surveillance emanating from the inflexible custodianship of a complete and atrocious normality. Surveillance, custodianship that could possibly be enforced beyond the boundaries of this enclosed world, because beyond the sheer masonry encasing this school, where the future ruling classes have studied and are studying, there is another world, there is an entire country that has virtually nothing to do with it.

Documentary	Using Goethe's Theory of Colours (Zur Farbenlehre) as point of departure, Light Darkness and Colours takes us on a fascinating journey through the universe of colours. In 1704, Sir Isaac Newton published *Light and Refraction*, his study of the interactions between sunlight and prisms. Newton was, as a good scientist, intent on achieving objectivity, which meant studying sunlight in isolation. He thought colours were contained solely in light, and found the spectrum he was looking for. When he reproduced this experiment, Goethe found another, hidden set of colours missed by Newton. Goethe found the hidden colours in the boundaries between light and darkness. He felt, as an artist, that one could not talk about light without including darkness. Calling it 'the light-darkness polarity', Goethe made this new scientific discovery using artistic methods in conjunction with science. As far as scientists were concerned, Goethe was a layman, which meant that his research went largely ignored. Not until many years later was it recognized how revolutionary his scientific discoveries really were. Goethe spent more than 40 years of his life on *Zur Farbenlehre*, which in its own way summarizes the whole of his thinking and connects his poetry with science. Goethe himself viewed his work as so stunningly radical that he prophesied that it would only be understood generations after his death. In keeping with Goethe's method, the three directors work from a personal curiosity as they explore the natural laws and phenomena surrounding human sensory perception. Using strikingly beautiful time-lapse cinematography, and duplicating Goethe's and Newton's experiments on camera, they have crafted a visually stunning and intellectually rewarding film.

Documentary	Why do we accept huge levels of inequality and social injustice? This is one of the central questions that The Price of Fairness sets out to answer, beginning with a surprising set of social experiments in Norway, which suggest that our willingness to support systems of inequality is far greater than we are often prepared to admit. In Atlanta, we take a different look at fairness, from the perspective of a group of capuchin monkeys. Behavioural scientist Sarah Bronson's work with the monkeys questions the idea that we have an evolutionary tendency towards selfish behaviour. Could it be that the outrage we feel towards systems of inequality have roots in our human need for cooperation? We visit Costa Rica and Iceland to see how whole economies have been engineered to function with greater 'fairness', and the US where systematic racial injustices have tested many of their citizens hopes for a fairer justice system. From the caste-biased villages of India to the race-sensitive streets of Ferguson, Missouri, this documentary explores our understanding of fairness and what it takes to change an unfair system. Touching on issues of economic, political, racial and gender inequality, this film offers a thought-provoking and timely look at what fairness really means to us.

Horror	S&MAN begins with footage from Michael Powell's exploration of voyeurism, "Peeping Tom." Director JT Petty uses this footage as a starting point to examine the classic comparison between filmmaking and voyeurism, particularly within the horror genre. He goes on to investigate this connection further, but rather than looking to classic horror films, Petty explores the seedy underground genre of fetish films. These movies are basically simulated snuff films where victims are raped and murdered in a variety of fantasy scenarios. The most notorious of these is a series called "S&Man," where voyeurism takes center stage as people are unknowingly followed with a camera. Petty plunges headfirst into this world of bizarre fetish films, and comes up with mesmerizing interviews with the producers and actors of these movies. Much of the footage from these videos will shock and disturb even the most seasoned horror veteran. However, the connection that Petty draws between these films and mainstream horror classics like "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" and "Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer" proves even more unsettling. Using interviews with Carol Clover (author off the definitive horror book, "Men, Women, and Chainsaws), and his personal experience as a horror director, Petty suggests that viewers' interest in horror films is rooted in the same voyeuristic urge to which these fetish videos appeal. Ulitmately, Petty directly confronts the audience, forcing them to examine their fascination with horror, torture, and violence. And for genre fans, these implications may make S&MAN the most unsettling horror film experience in years.

Documentary	Jazz in Turkey? Jazz in Turkey the documentary can be summarized as a project in which I explore the condition, evolution and interaction of Turkish jazz music and its musicians, in parallel to Turkish history. The spark for this project, I suppose, were my encounters with Ilhan Mimaroglu's late 50s book "Caz Sanati" and the slim appendix called "Summary: Jazz in Turkey" in Cuneyt Sermet's 90s book "Cazin icinden". Afterwards, conversations with the Focan family led me to realize that despite the massive intention for research and observation regarding the topic, the project was yet an orphan. In a country with limited archives, calling the oral history-based project a daring "Turkish Jazz History" would be beyond me, so I decided to name it Jazz in Turkey instead. We started filming in 2011. The greatest hindrance for an oral history project, I suppose, is the potential of the interviewees getting lost in the turbulent waters that range between deep modesty and high ego when talking about themselves. Turkey's jazz story, which I compiled from interviews with 50 people, partially carries elements of a chronological history documentary. However, due to the interviewees' approach and what they delivered, I started evaluating it as "the impact of jazz music to Turkey." When this impact is attributed to a sociological development process, one can easily notice the structure evolving in phases. The codes involved in the process are political manoeuvres, mimicry, original advancements, technical development, social perception, determinant self-confidence and artistic spirit. I think, this documentary's mission is to voice a sincere "interpretation" of how outright facts are perceived in different social strata, rather than revealing buried historical truth. A sincere "interpretation" that pours from the minds and hearts of dozens of people... Jazz in Turkey is easily the first product in cinema format on this subject, which also covers then-broadcasted TV and radio shows. I am aware of the obsession with saying something is "a first in Turkey." However rather than concentrating on its "first"ness, what motivates me more is wishing that it will not be the "last."

Drama	Dan Dunne is an eighth-grade history teacher in an inner-city school deep in the heart of Brooklyn. He eschews the provided curriculum in favor of off-the-cuff, but deeply heartfelt lectures about the importance of understanding history, rather than just memorizing it. He speaks primarily of dialectics, the tensions between two opposing forces. He is torn between his desire to change the world and his increasingly desperate realization that he can't, at least not in the grand, awe-inspiring ways that he envisioned as an eager, idealistic college student. He started using drugs as a way to escape the pain of life, and it has turned into a crutch that bears increasingly heavy loads of psychological weight. In his classroom, which is populated almost entirely by black and Hispanic students, Dan lectures about how the world is structured into opposing forces, illustrating it at one point by arm-wrestling one of his students. His unorthodox approach inspires them during class, but interestingly enough we don't see its effects outside the classroom. The film focuses on Dan and his relationship with Drey, a 13-year-old student of his who catches him in the bathroom smoking crack after school one day. Drey understands Dan's frustrations with life; she is the child of an overworked single mother whom she barely sees, and spending so much time on her own has made her self-reliant, but also hard on the edges.

A strange uneasiness grips him when he sees that he does not make just the impression he expected. Little by little he succeeds in making himself the most thoroughly disliked and abhorred person on the campus. "Dink" rises a point in his schoolmates' estimation when he discovers on reporting to the Latin class that the instructor is no other than the traveling man of the stage on the day of his arrival, and in order to make good some of the many boasts he made on that day fakes the translation. The Roman, possessed of a good sense of humor, compliments "Dink" on his performance, much to everyone's surprise. The first girl to attract "Dink" Stover is no other than the pretty daughter of the Roman, considerably older than he is. After a short and one-sided flirtation, Miss McCarty becomes engaged to another man and "Dink" is desperate, until some new neckwear comes in at the local haberdasher's and diverts his mind from his agony. As a result of his neglect of study, "Dink" finds himself about to be dropped in school for falling off in his studies. He is to have a private examination at the Roman's house. Stover decides to cheat, and arranges with the Tennessee Shad and MacNooder to overturn a large water cooler outside the Roman's door and other devices to get him out of the way. To his utter dismay, the Roman goes out of the room and stays, thus putting him on his honor. "Dink" signs his name at the head of the blank paper and is dumbfounded when, upon the Roman's return, he seems to scan the blank sheets closely and says : "I think this will about pass you, Stover." The two discover that they had been friends from the first and "Dink" really comes into his own when the Roman explains that as he is now an upper classman, it is up to him to set a good example to the younger boys.

However, above one of the city's villas, once a week in the evening the stars of hope sparkle, if only for a few minutes. This short time gives fresh heart to those hiding here and kindles hope in their tortured souls to live for another day. This mysterious power is none other than a beautiful song that can be heard at such times from the villa's tower room. Géza Halász, the villa's always jovial caretaker, believes no Jew has reason to fear while the owner of the voice, Imre Rose, the world-famous opera singer and a Jew himself, remains in Budapest and does not flee from the country in spite of his American, British, Swiss, Swedish and Vatican connections. Halász visits the singer every Friday to dine with him. After a while the marvellous, hope-inspiring concert starts, which is listened to by the hiding inhabitants of the house with enraptured faces through the villa's open dumb waiter. Already in the "palmy years of peacetime" Rose had competed with Csortos, the famous actor, for the title of "Budapest's Greatest Misanthrope". Thus it does not surprise anybody that the eccentric singer never, not even once, tries to make contact with his fellow Jews who took refuge in his house. And when Halász recounts that the singer swore within an hour of the Arrow Cross's seizing power that he would not utter a single word nor cross the threshold of his tower room until "Andrássy Avenue has been purged of this Arrow Cross scum", even the slightest suspicion about Rose's "invisibility" vanishes. Only a fourteen-year-old boy, Tommy, the caretaker's son, listens to the weekly song with curiosity combined with suspicion, and tries to find out about the secret of the tower room. As a result of the adolescent's persistent and undaunted inquiries, the opera singer's mystery is unveiled. Meanwhile, however, almost unnoticed, the events of the calamitous days, filled with excitement and cheerfulness, turn the boy into a truly adult man.

Hari and his brother Bolai (Noni Ganguly) are Borgadars, land tillers who plough and harvest the crop on land owned by Jotdars. Bibhutibhushan Ganguly (Victor Banerjee) is the young jotdar who has just lost his father and now wishes to employ new laws on his Borgadars ensuring his greatest profit while the poor farmer languishes in poverty. His estate agent Karmakar(Rajen Tarafdar)does most of his dirty dealings on his behalf that include keeping the poor villagers scared and in command. Hari's sister is about to get married and Hari asks Bibhutibhushan for a loan. Bibhutibhushan asks him to not register his Bargadari rights under the government office in exchange. Hari is naive and moulded under generations of servility and oppression to realise that his basic righta are being squandered although his younger brother Bolai isn't happy remaining as mere servants to the landlord. Bolai protests on multiple occasions only to be reprimanded by his brother and Karmakar. Bolai and Panchi(Sreela Majumdar) love each other. Over time, as the communist movement gets stronger in the region, Hari Mandal keeps on getting oppressed under whims and fancies of the Jotdar, that include making him a paid labourer on his own plot of land and sacking his brother from working with him. Bolai is disgusted with the village life and moves to the big city of Calcutta for work. Here, he joins a small-time racket of wagon breakers and eventually becomes a political goon for the city's electoral candidates. Panchi and her mother both move to Calcutta with help from strangers who offer them employment. While Kalidashi gets employed in a middle-class home as the cook cum servant for a meagre salary, her daughter is trapped with the bait of fancy clothes by a pimp employed by a middle aged Marwari businessman\Seth ji who makes her his mistress. Panchi also seems to enjoy her new life and the luxuries of cosmetics, silk sarees and a huge bed to sleep on. In a poignant scene, before bedding her for the first time, Seth ji asks her whether she has ever slept on a bed before. Hari fights his battles alone against the Jotdar and eventually registers a case against him in the district court with help from sympathetic village master (Pankaj Kapoor) and a lawyer who fights his case for free. Although the district magistrate (Jayant Kripalani) is sympathetic and just in his dealing to his cause, the Jotdar uses his muscle to beat up Hari, burn down his house and take away his bullocks thus leaving him helpless to fight. Hari presses on and the case reaches the High Court where his case is dismissed in favour of the Jotdar. Meanwhile, the first leftist communist government is established in Bengal and after years of court battle and a Panchayat election where Hari defeats Karmakar to become the village Panch, finally he receives his Bargadari certificate-at the cost of a broken leg, a house, and a brother who is lost forever.

Documentary	American public schools have been growing progressively worse. According to the U.S. Department of Education national testing, only 35% of American high school seniors are proficient in reading, based on 2006 data. And fewer than one-in-four, 23%, are proficient in math. On the global stage, America ranks last in educational effectiveness among large industrialized countries despite the highest spending per student in the world. It presents a conundrum: How has the richest and most innovative society on earth suddenly lost the ability to teach its children at a level that other modern countries consider "basic"? If the problem is that we're not spending enough on schools, which many people believe, it's instructive to study the U.S. state that spends more than any other per student: New Jersey With spending as high as $483,000 per classroom (confirmed by NJ Education Department records for 2005-06), New Jersey students fare only slightly better than the national average in reading and math, and rank 37th in average SAT scores. And not even half of NJ's high school freshmen, despite the state's enormous "investment," are academically ready for college four years later. The fact is much of the public considers teacher salaries and overall education budgets to be the same thing -- if you're for raising one, you must be for raising the other. But as the film shows, in many cases 80-90% of the spending goes somewhere besides teacher salaries. In fact billions of dollars, as confirmed by independent audits, are wasted. "The Cartel" investigates what is causing this vast underachievement and what can be done to turn things around.

Western	While not exact remakes, two 1945 westerns - Republic's Wagon Wheels Westward and Monogram's Springtime in Texas - are close enough to the plot of Universal's 1943 Cheyenne Roundup to be labeled next-of-kin versions. Republic's offering finds The Duchess and her nephew Red Ryder setting out to pioneer a new stagecoach line through the wild, rough country leading to Desert Springs, a small, isolated town. To ensure the customer base for the new line, they are bringing with them a wagon train of prospective settlers who want land of their own and have the cash to pay for it. Red and the Duchess are unaware that their letter to John Larkin, the hotel owner and land agent in Desert Springs, has been intercepted by Dave McKean and his henchmen. McKean has intentions of letting Larkin complete the land deals and then he and his gang will steal the money. Arriving in Desert Springs, McKean & Co. are startled to find the town completely deserted (because of a rumored gold strike elsewhere), with signs that all of the citizens pulled out in a hurry. Seeing this as even a better opportunity, McKean sets himself and his men up as the town's officials and await the arrival of the prospective pigeons. An added subplot involves newly-wed Arlie Adams, a member of the wagon train, being blackmailed by Lunsford over an earlier scandal and, while she was innocently involved, still doesn't want husband Bob Adams to learn about it.

Documentary	The incomparable splendor of Naples, situated in the shadow of a volcano and by the blue sea of an enormous bay, inspired Johann Wolfgang von Goethe to the famous statement: "See Naples and die". But Naples also has a more complex side. Behind the splendor and pomp that dates from the time when Naples still had great political and social influence, one can also find poverty and adversity. The film director Vincent Monnikendam ends in the backstreets and steep alleyways where sunlight barely penetrates, where dark drama and frivolity keep the age-old city in their grip. The central feature of the film is the painting The Seven Acts of Mercy by Caravaggio, the master of the clair-obscur. This altar piece was painted in 1607, commissioned by the noble founders of the Pio Monte della Misericordia, a charitable institution that is still active. Myths about this painting, the history of the Pio Monte, the joy and sorrow of Neapolitans, alternate and combine to form a colourful portrait. With a leading role for the city of Naples itself. Among the important characters in Souls of Naples are Pietro Gargano, editor-in-chief of the newspaper Il Mattino and a connoisseur of urban history, and Gian Paolo Leonetti, former chairman of the Pio Monte della Misericordia and a descendant of a noble family. The baroque interior of the villa where we meet contrasts with the sober entourage of the inner city. This is where the transsexual Gianni earns a meagre income by selling lottery tickets and Pina tells us about her difficult existence while she sews trendy handbags in a small factory located in an old cellar. The Russian painter Natalia Tsarkova tries to communicate in her own work the essence of clair-obscur in the paintings by Caravaggio whom she so admires. According to her, the special lighting effects with powerful contrasts so characteristic of his work are the symbol of survival, for good and evil, for life and death. In a style inspired by these characteristic light-dark contrasts Souls of Naples provides an inspiring portrait of a city that has survived for two and half thousand years.
Documentary	On the eve of her 70th birthday, Canadian writer Margaret Atwood set out on an international tour criss-crossing the British Isles and North America to celebrate the publication of her new dystopian novel, The Year of the Flood. But rather than mount a traditional tour to promote a book's publication, Atwood conceived and executed something far more ambitious and revelatory-a theatrical version of her novel. Along the way she reinvented what a book tour could be. But Atwood wasn't selling books as much as advocating an idea. Her primary concern was to do what she could to ensure the continued life of the birds of the skies-especially song birds. Atwood's odyssey is now captured in Ron Mann's new film, In The Wake of the Flood. Rendered as a fly-on-the-wall film verite, In The Wake of the Flood mixes new footage, archival materials and evocative CGI in featuring Atwood on the road and at home as an aging but buoyant literary rock star spreading a message of warning and hope as she staged and participated in the novel production. Margaret Atwood is, of course, one of the most acclaimed literary voices of this generation. The author of more than a dozen novels, numerous collections of poetry, children's books, and countless essays, Atwood's triumphs have been lauded on the highest levels throughout the world. In each community she visited, Atwood joined volunteer performers in a loose-knit, grass roots production drawn from the text of her novel. With its mystical, Blakean overtones, Atwood's theatrical version of The Year of the Flood acts as a song cycle that seeks to shake the human race into an awareness of the fragility of the natural world and our vital connection to it. To bring her novel into a live setting, Atwood teamed with Los Angeles composer Orville Stoeber to write a new style of devotional music influenced by the related genres of country ballads, gospel, jazz and folk. Each performance included a cast of local readers and singers taking the roles of different characters in key scenes from the novel. The events were primarily staged in cathedrals, adding a grand visual element to the proceedings and a layer of ceremonial gravitas. From Edinburgh and London to New York City, Toronto and Vancouver, Atwood emerges as a wizened elf whose rare sensibility is always in the foreground: a life and art coalesced into a unity of medium and message.

The fact that the filmmakers family is integral to this slice of life takes us that much closer to it all.

Drama	A rebellious little boy has been taken away from his abusive mother and placed in the temporary care of a young couple. And while Mario is a singular child, commendably portrayed by the pugilistic Marco Grieco, what turns Antonio Capuano's Mario's War into a fine film is not just this penetrating performance but the sensitive depiction of the new world that envelops this young boy.

Not only does she have to grapple with every obstacle Mario throws at her, but she has to cope with the doubts and hesitation of Sandro (Andrea Renzi), the man she lives with and loves... Hovering uneasily over the film is the issue of making a defiant kid fit into a system that may not suit him.

Capuano's skill at balancing these competing forces is exemplary, turning Mario's War into a complex portrait of a woman and her chosen son.

Now more than ever - it seems that this was not the case. Countless first responders - emergency technicians, police officers, and firefighters - have grown ill as a result of their exposure to toxins from the smoldering pile that once was the World Trade Center.

The ultra orthodox community in general & its women in particular are extremely wary of media exposure. The film therefore provides a rare look into the lives of ultra orthodox women, their activities & their grasp of their identities. Tikkun portrays the phenomenon of the Rabbanit (the wife of a Rabbi) of Tiberius, Leah Kook, an orthodox leader followed by many Israeli women. This film is a vivid picture of the routines and customs of life in an ultra-orthodox household and introduces a very charismatic,yet highly controversial main character.

As the maker of the film disguised herself and became one of the members of the house she could explore the backyard of the scene. The surprising cooperation demonstrated by the rabbanit in making this film, and her agreement to such intimate exposure of her physical & spiritual world for two years were a form of "Tikkun" for her. By watching the Rabanit from almost no distance at all, one could reach a conclusion to the controversial attitude of the Israeli society towards Lea Kook: is she genuine or a fraud?

Documentary	In this inspired, genre-twisting new film, Oscar®-nominated writer/director Sarah Polley discovers that the truth depends on who's telling it.

As each relates their version of the family mythology, present-day recollections shift into nostalgia-tinged glimpses of their mother, who departed too soon, leaving a trail of unanswered questions. Polley unravels the paradoxes to reveal the essence of family: always complicated, warmly messy and fiercely loving. Stories We Tell explores the elusive nature of truth and memory, but at its core is a deeply personal film about how our narratives shape and define us as individuals and families, all interconnecting to paint a profound, funny and poignant picture of the larger human story.

Documentary	A visually rich travelogue from Bali, Brazil, England, Haiti, Spain and the U.S.A., with a couple of scenes from China originally shot for Notater fra Kina, and a number of scenes with Leth's children in Denmark.

It includes the words "I play, I can do anything. Nothing is forbidden. I create my own world. I systematize chaos. I keep a balance as long as I think it is worth keeping".

The film was created in continuation of, and drawing on, Leth and Holmberg's experience in making Peter Martins - en danser. It primarily concentrates on the work of the charming, affected Hans Brenå in rehearsal and on stage with two young dancers in a production of Bournonville's Kermessen i Brügge.

The Royal Danish Ballet is described as "a workshop for dance where the quality of the old steps needs honing and refining every single day".

Documentary	In 1986, I filmed for the first time in Haladiya Street in the Moslem Quarter of Jerusalem. Since then I have been constantly returning and documenting all the turbulent changes in the street. It is a street with whispers and magic and our story revolves around two central figures who live here, Abu Bassem, a Palestinian, and Danny Rubins, a Jewish settler. I first filmed Abu Bassem in November 1986. That was after a rabbinical student from the "Shuvu Banim" yeshiva was stabbed to death near Abu Bassem's home by three Palestinians from Jenin. To this day Abu Bassem lives in the same house where he was born 57 years ago. Now Abu Bassem finds himself in one continuous on going battle against pressure to evict him from his apartment. I also met Danny for the first time in November 1986. At that time Danny was a new resident who had come from America and was reconstructing his house in the courtyard facing Abu Bassem's apartment. At that time all his neighbors were Arabs. The material, which I filmed over the years, showing the density, the intimacies and complexities of life on the street, can also be seen as a microcosm of what is happening in the battle for the soul of Jerusalem.

Drama	"Life, Love, Death" was made before the abolition of capital punishment in France. Its central message is the inhumanity of the guillotine. The film, which is shot somewhat in a cinema verite style, divides roughly into three acts. In Act One, there is a series of murders of prostitutes in Paris. An obviously deeply disturbed man is hiring these prostitutes and then strangling them. Suspicion falls on François (Amidou), a married man with a child. The police put him under surveillance. (Viewers will recognize the inspector in charge of the team as Marcel Bozzuffi, who would play Popeye Doyle's nemesis in The French Connection a couple of years later.) Ironically, François is experiencing spiritual healing and renewal through the power of love---not with his wife, of course, this being a French film, but through an affair with a beautiful young woman he has met (not a prostitute). But just as this is happening and François seems to have lost the need to commit violent crimes, he is arrested. Act Two is the arraignment, trial and exposition of François's life and history. His recent transformation, of course, makes no impression on the court, and he is sentenced to death by guillotine. Act Three is a documentary-style record of François's last days in prison and his execution. The last scene in the film is an image of the guillotine's blade beginning its descent; it slows and freezes and there is a fade to black, as a voiceover issues a passionate plea for abolition of the guillotine.

Comedy	INDIE DIRECTOR: In 2006 Bill Zebub shot a comedy about the making of a horror movie, and this was titled "ASSMONSTER" - a title that gave a lot of would-be viewers the wrong idea, but that didn't stop the movie from playing at the Fantasia Film Festival as well as the Hollywood Film Festival. This story, simply named "Indie Director" is about an auteur who refuses to compromise his values, but this is not a Disney movies. His values are about criticizing beliefs and policies, as well as about shocking the hell out of people in order to make them think. He will never cater to people who have a short attention span, nor brainwashed conformists, nor will he dumb down his scripts. That is, until one of his experimental movies explodes on the adult industry scene (even though it isn't porn). When he makes another movie to capitalize on the success, he doesn't realize that he has compromised. The story is not just his. This movie invites you to take a look at the world of micro budget indie cinema. The point is to entertain you while also teaching you some insider knowledge. You'll love this story even if you don't care about the genre, but if you are part of the industry, you will hail this as your video bible.
